## Simple Page Test (Gatsby + React + Netlify)
### Form validation
Despite Formik being recommended for form validation, I decided to use Redux and create a straightforward logical structure and flow for this, utilizing regular expressions and the native browser's `checkValidity` method of inputs to meticulously examine and ensure the data integrity of forms. Incorporating full-fledged form validators can significantly increase the file size, potentially impacting the user experience, so I opted for a more lightweight approach.
### Shared state management
I decided to use Redux. Initially, I wanted to leverage the Context API for this, but I realized it would require additional boilerplate code. Therefore, I opted for Redux, a well-tested solution for shared state management in React.
### Context API for storing shared refs
I could have easily used a simple ID for the email address input so that I can focus on it from anywhere in the application. However, this approach of using IDs is not scalable and poses the risk of ID duplication, which could lead to complications. Instead, by utilizing the Context API to store and share refs, we eliminate the need for IDs and significantly reduce the chances of duplication issues. This approach allows us to mitigate risks and maintain a more robust and scalable solution.
### Tailwind for styling and layout
Tailwind is a great option, not only during the development stages of the application but also for the design team to adhere to parametric spacing and colors. I have decided to install it to accelerate and streamline the development process, gaining speed and efficiency.
### Netlify for bulding and deployment
There will be a streamlined pipeline configured in such a way that with every commit to the master branch, the site will be built and deployed to the Netlify server.

  Gatsby's default starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üöÄ Quick start (Netlify)

Deploy this starter with one click on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup):

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
